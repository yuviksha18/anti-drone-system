<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
Unauthorized drones are becoming a serious national threat. From airports to defence bases,
from public rallies to government facilities – rogue drones can perform illegal surveillance,
smuggling, sabotage or terror attacks. Our Anti-Drone Surveillance System is designed to detect,
track, classify and neutralize unauthorized drones using smart sensor fusion and AI-driven threat
analysis.

This project continuously monitors airspace, identifies suspicious UAV movement, evaluates
risk levels in real time and provides operators with actionable intelligence. It bridges the gap
between detection and response by offering automated threat escalation indicators and command
controls to initiate counter-measures. The system can be integrated with RF scanners, radar,
camera feeds and acoustic sensors, making it adaptable for defence forces, airports, power
stations, stadiums and border security.

<section id="why">
<h2>Why We Chose This Project</h2>
<p>
With the rapid increase in drone availability, misuse of UAVs has become extremely easy.
Traditional security systems are not capable of detecting aerial intrusions at low altitude.
This project aims to fill that gap by introducing a centralized intelligent monitoring platform.

This solution is useful for military operators, airport authorities, police departments,
critical infrastructure managers and disaster-response teams. It helps prevent terrorist
activities, illegal spying, contraband deliveries and ensures civilian safety during large
public gatherings. This system empowers security agencies to act before threats escalate.

<h2>Project Growth Rate & Market Adoption</h2>
<p>
The global counter-drone market is witnessing exponential growth. Defence ministries,
civil aviation authorities and smart city planners are rapidly investing in anti-drone
solutions. This chart shows how different sectors are adopting this technology and how
future investments are expected to rise across the world.
